ECE </br>
Spring 2022 </br>
**Instructor:** Cristina Comaniciu </br>

## COURSE DESCRIPTION

The goal of the course is to teach all the components reequired to successfuly run a simulation for discrete event driven systems, with the main application examples being focused on networks. The course has two main threads: a theoretical component focused on modeling discrete event driven systems, and a software implementation component - learning to build simulation models using a simulation environment (OMNET++). The final project requires to put all the elements together to model, code and obtain and interpret simulation results for a chosen application example.

## STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES

* Learning outcome 1: The student will be able to statistically characterize physical processes: identify their mean and variance, and probability distribution function (probability mass function) based on underlying properties of the processes, or by empirical measurements, and using goodness of fit tests.
* Learning outcome 2: The student will be able to characterize physical systems using mathematical models, based on description of real systems and their physical variables. This implies the ability of recognizing various queueing models.
* Learning outcome 3: The student will be able to analyze the performance of various systems modeled as queues, and interpret the mathematical results in terms of system stability, delay performance, system utilization (efficiency).
* Learning outcome 4: The student will master basic programming skills using a simulation environment, OMNET++. The student will be able to design and run simple simulation examples,using OMNET++.
* Learning outcome 5: The students will understand the computer implementation of random number generators and will be able to implement their own random number generators, with specified parameters: probability distribution function (or probability mass function), mean and variance.
* Learning outcome 6: The students will be able to validate their analytical, or simulation results by using face validity tests, based on their understanding of the relationship between input and output data, in the analyzed or simulated system.
* Learning outcome 7: The student will be able to develop and assess alternative system designs based on system requirements, cost and time constraints, environmental safeguards, marketingfeatures and other non-technical issues.

## Academic Integrity

### Undergraduate Honor System

Enrollment into the undergraduate class of Stevens Institute of Technology signifies a student's commitment to the Honor System. Accordingly, the provisions of the Stevens Honor System apply to all undergraduate students in coursework and Honor Board proceedings. It is the responsibility of each student to become acquainted with and to uphold the ideals set forth in the Honor System Constitution. More information about the Honor System including the constitution, bylaws, investigative procedures, and the penalty matrix can be found [online.](http://web.stevens.edu/honor/) </br>

The following pledge shall be written in full and signed by every student on all submitted work(including, but not limited to, homework, projects, lab reports, code, quizzes and exams) that is assigned by the course instructor. No work shall be graded unless the pledge is written in full and signed. </br>

***"I pledge my honor that I have abided by the Stevens Honor System."*** </br>
*Reporting Honor System Violations*
Students who believe a violation of the Honor System has been commited should report it within ten business days of the suspected violation. Students should have the option to remain anonymous and can report violations [online.](www.stevens.edu/honor) </br>

## EXAM CONDITIONS

Exams will be in class </br>
Exams are closed book. One cheat sheet with formulas (double sided) is allowed. Calculators are allowed. </br>

## LEARNING ACCOMMODATIONS

Stevens Institute of Technology is dedicated to providing appropriate accommodations to students with documented disabilities. The Office of Disability Services (ODS) works with undergraduate and graduate students with learning disabilities, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorders, physical disabilities, sensory impairments, psychiatric disorders, and other such disabilities in order to help students achieve their academic and personal potential. They facilitate equal access to the educational programs and opportunities offered at Stevens and coordinate reasonable accommodations for eligible students. These services are designed to encourage independence and self-advocacy with support from the ODS staff. The ODS staff will facilitate the provision ofaccommodations on a case-by-case basis. </br>

**Disability Services Confidentialiy Policy** </br>
Student Disability Files are kept separate from academic files and are stored in a secure locationvwithin the Office of Disability Services. The Family Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA, 20 U.S.C. 1232g; 34CFR, Part 99) regulates disclosure of disability documentation and records maintained by Stevens Disability Services. According to this act, prior written consent by the student is required before our Disability Services office may release disability documentation or records to anyone. An exception is made in unusual circumstances, such as the case of health and safety emergencies.

## INCLUSIVITY

**Name and Pronoun Usage** </br>
As this course includes group work and class discussion, it is vitally important for us to create an educational environment of inclusion and mutual respect. This includes the ability for all students to have their chosen gender pronoun(s) and chosen name affirmed. If the class roster does not align with your name and/or pronouns, please inform the instructor of the necessary changes. </br>
**Inclusion Statement**
Stevens Institute of Technology believes that diversity and inclusiveness are essential to excellence in academic discourse and innovation. In this class, the perspective of people of all races, ethnicities, gender expressions and gender identities, religions, sexual orientations, disabilities, socioeconomic backgrounds, and nationalities will be respected and viewed as a resource and benefit throughout the semester. Suggestions to further diversify class materials and assignments are encouraged. If any course meetings conflict with your religious events, please do not hesitate to reach out to yourinstructor to make alternative arrangements. </br>
You are expected to treat your instructor and all other participants in the course with courtesy and respect. Disrespectful conduct and harassing statements will not be tolerated and may result in disciplinary actions.
