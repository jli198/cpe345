## COURSE DESCRIPTION

The goal of the course is to teach all the components reequired to successfuly run a simulation for discrete event driven systems, with the main application examples being focused on networks. The course has two main threads: a theoretical component focused on modeling discrete event driven systems, and a software implementation component - learning to build simulation models using a simulation environment (OMNET++). The final project requires to put all the elements together to model, code and obtain and interpret simulation results for a chosen application example.

## STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES

* Learning outcome 1: The student will be able to statistically characterize physical processes: identify their mean and variance, and probability distribution function (probability mass function) based on underlying properties of the processes, or by empirical measurements, and using goodness of fit tests.
* Learning outcome 2: The student will be able to characterize physical systems using mathematical models, based on description of real systems and their physical variables. This implies the ability of recognizing various queueing models.
* Learning outcome 3: The student will be able to analyze the performance of various systems modeled as queues, and interpret the mathematical results in terms of system stability, delay performance, system utilization (efficiency).
* Learning outcome 4: The student will master basic programming skills using a simulation environment, OMNET++. The student will be able to design and run simple simulation examples,using OMNET++.
* Learning outcome 5: The students will understand the computer implementation of random number generators and will be able to implement their own random number generators, with specified parameters: probability distribution function (or probability mass function), mean and variance.
* Learning outcome 6: The students will be able to validate their analytical, or simulation results by using face validity tests, based on their understanding of the relationship between input and output data, in the analyzed or simulated system.
* Learning outcome 7: The student will be able to develop and assess alternative system designs based on system requirements, cost and time constraints, environmental safeguards, marketingfeatures and other non-technical issues.

### Instructor's Online Hours

I will be available via email and will respond as soon as possible (generally within 24-48 hours). When emailing me, please place in the subject line the course number/section and the topic of the email (e.g. CPE345 Homework 2 Question). This will help me tremendously in locating your emails quicker when I scan the hundreds of emails that seem to make it into my inbox each day.
